## Overview

This analysis explores data from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) in conjunction with state-level information from census.gov. The goal is to derive insights into gun registrations by investigating relationships between NICS data and census variables.

## Objective

1. Identify the census variable most associated with high gun per capita.
2. Determine states with the highest growth in gun registrations.
3. Understand the overall trend of gun purchases.

## Data Source

- Gun data: One sheet in an .xlsx file containing firearm checks by month, state, and type.
- U.S. census data: A .csv file with state-level variables, primarily one data point per state for 2016, with a few variables spanning multiple years.
